# Affordable-Fun

This is an Android app that helps college students to plan a fun and affordable weekend getaway with only a few clicks.

College students nowadays are definitely in  of a simple money-saving app. With limitneeded funds and high tuition fees, they tend to have very limited money for extra expenses. However, the city and the events in it is a crucial part of the college experience. We hope to help college students plan a fun trip to explore the city while also saving money.

As a student from Columbia University, I have constantly faced the weekend dilemma. I am always fascinated by the Broadway events, However, I am also afraid to do so because its high cost. In addition, I don't usually have time to carefully research and plan those trips. Therefore, I really need an app that plans the fun weekend getaways and provide me with affordable solutions.

This app uses the Ticketmaster API that searches for all the discount ticket deals within a certain radius of the user's location. The tickets are for events including movies, performances and concerts. The user can specify the type of events he/she hope to attend. We also use the data from Google Directions API to fetch the transit cost of the two-way trip. The transit cost and the ticket cost are added together and sorted to offer the users a list of cheapest weekend trips.

Recognizing student's need to dine after/before attending events, the app then searches around the event venue for a list of affordable and quality food. The restaurants are searched with the Yelp API.

Once the user decides on the event and the restaurant, the app automatically plans the trip for the user. It shows the directions. It also provides links to the specific ticket ordering sites.

The app is built with the Ionic framework and can be deployed on both Android and IOS platform. The app functionalities are implemented with Javascript and AngularJs framework.

The app is a product of the 2016 Yale University Hackathon (YHack) and achieved Finalist in the event.
